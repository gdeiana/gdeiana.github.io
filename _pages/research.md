Are lockdown policies effective at inducing physical distancing to
counter the spread of COVID-19? Can less restrictive measures that
rely on voluntary community action achieve a similar effect? Using
data from 40 million mobile devices, we find that a lockdown increases
the percentage of people who stay at home by 8% across US counties.
Grouping states with similar outbreak trajectories together and using
an instrumental variables approach, we show that time spent at home
can increase by as much as 39%. Moreover, we show that individuals
engage in limited physical distancing even in the absence of such
policies, once the virus takes hold in their area. Our analysis suggests
that non-causal estimates of lockdown policies’ effects can yield biased
results. We show that counties where people have less distrust in science,
are more highly educated, or have higher incomes see a substantially
higher uptake of voluntary physical distancing. This suggests that the
targeted promotion of distancing among less responsive groups may
be as effective as across-the-board lockdowns, while also being less
damaging to the economy.

### [No More Free Choice: An Empirical Analysis of Default Options in the Amazon Marketplace](https://gdeiana.github.io/assets/docs/Amazon_choice.pdf)

The purpose of this work is to estimate the impact of products suggestions
in an online marketplace on consumer choice. Specifically, we focus on the
Amazon marketplace and we study how a platform suggestion (the “Amazon’s Choice” badge) affects demand. 
We collected data on usb cables sold
in the five Amazon Europe marketplaces and from numerous sources we obtained
the time series of prices, reviews, and of a proxy for sales. Then, we
developed a discrete choice model in the characteristics’ space. Following the
Empirical Industrial Organization literature, the model is then estimated using
a Nested Logit and a Random Coeﬀicient Logit (BLP). The models show
that the “Amazon’s Choice” badge has an extremely large, positive, and statistically 
significant effect on demand. These results show the potential for
distortion of consumers’ choice coming from a vertically integrated platform
which competes with third party sellers in its own environment.
