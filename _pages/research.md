Are lockdown policies effective at inducing physical distancing to
counter the spread of COVID-19? Can less restrictive measures that
rely on voluntary community action achieve a similar effect? Using
data from 40 million mobile devices, we find that a lockdown increases
the percentage of people who stay at home by 8% across US counties.
Grouping states with similar outbreak trajectories together and using
an instrumental variables approach, we show that time spent at home
can increase by as much as 39%. Moreover, we show that individuals
engage in limited physical distancing even in the absence of such
policies, once the virus takes hold in their area. Our analysis suggests
that non-causal estimates of lockdown policiesâ€™ effects can yield biased
results. We show that counties where people have less distrust in science,
are more highly educated, or have higher incomes see a substantially
higher uptake of voluntary physical distancing. This suggests that the
targeted promotion of distancing among less responsive groups may
be as effective as across-the-board lockdowns, while also being less
damaging to the economy.
