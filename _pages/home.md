My name is Guido Deiana, I am a MSc in Economics Graduate, currently working as a Research Assistant at Bocconi University in Milan.  
In the Fall of 2022, I will start my PhD in Economics at the New York University.  
My main research interests are Microeconomics, Industrial Organization and Labor Economics. When I am not working in front of a laptop, I like spending time in the mountains, climbing or skiing.  

Here you can find my contact information, my [CV](https://gdeiana.github.io/assets/docs/Guido_Deiana_CV.pdf) and a few blog posts. If you find something interesting don't hesitate to contact me!
